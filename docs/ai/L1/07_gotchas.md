> High-impact setup and business-state pitfalls.

## Setup Pitfalls

- pnpm 8 does not match lockfile 9; use declared pnpm 9.15.9.
- Missing .env.local values fail doctor; do not log or paste credentials.
- Docker needs a running engine and the public App ID at build time. A runtime-only ID cannot repair an already-built client bundle.
- A private/localhost callback URL cannot be used as a cloud business-tool origin.

## Runtime Pitfalls

Job requirements and interview topics are in the prompt. Candidate answers are summarized verbally; no candidate record is saved.

There is no applicant-tracking integration, durable interview record, hiring score, automatic rejection or offer. Candidate statements are not independently verified facts. Sensitive personal characteristics are not interview criteria.

A Next.js deployment can serve the voice app and stateless result endpoint. No database is included. Add your own durable, authorized ATS integration before claiming saved interview results.

Keep combined token privileges, StrictMode initialization, toolkit readiness and hook-owned cleanup. A missing transcript is an RTM/event question, not evidence that the model never responded. Tool failures cannot silently fall back to fixture success.

## Documentation Or Contract Drift

The repository identity must be `littleDogWang/06-recruitment-screening`, while upstream attribution remains separate. Keep invite fields, data paths, time zones, Docker volume behavior and pnpm/verification commands synchronized. Run `pnpm run verify:template` for structure/link drift and the canonical checks for source behavior.
