> Trust boundaries and unsafe sample defaults.

## Trust Boundaries

The browser is untrusted. Next.js owns the App Certificate, token signing and Agent start/stop. Agora cloud processes voice and invokes only configured business tools. There is no applicant-tracking integration, durable interview record, hiring score, automatic rejection or offer. Candidate statements are not independently verified facts. Sensitive personal characteristics are not interview criteria.

## Secrets

Keep certificates and opt-in provider keys server-side in .env.local or deployment secret storage. The App ID is public and is a Docker build argument; the certificate is never a build argument. Ignore env files, .agora bindings, generated logs and local business data in Git/images. Never include them in diagnostics or screenshots. Rotate exposed credentials with their owner and redeploy the new runtime values.

## Authentication And Authorization

Token routes issue scoped expiring RTC/RTM credentials; preserve renewal of both client identities. Sample start/stop/business endpoints are not production login or tenant authorization. Random call/session capabilities only scope the simulation; they do not authenticate a real customer or patient. Add application authentication/authorization before real-user deployment.

## Input And Output Handling

Validate route and tool arguments, preserve explicit confirmation and return actual errors. Never reveal secrets, other sessions or fixture identity keys to help a caller match. Do not derive contact permission or business success from transcript keywords. Use fictional data.

A Next.js deployment can serve the voice app and stateless result endpoint. No database is included. Add your own durable, authorized ATS integration before claiming saved interview results.

The image runs as UID 1001 and owns .scenario-data; mounted storage must remain writable by that user. Existing session/storage lifetime constraints still apply inside a container.

## Security Reporting

Report privately to security@agora.io. Do not open public issues containing credentials or personal data.
